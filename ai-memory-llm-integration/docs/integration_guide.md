# Integration Guide for AI Memory System with LLMs

## Overview

This integration guide provides detailed instructions on how to integrate the Persistent AI Memory System with various Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to enable seamless interaction between the memory system and LLMs, allowing for enhanced capabilities in managing conversations, storing memories, and retrieving information.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Access to an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
- The AI Memory System installed and configured

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-memory-llm-integration.git
   cd ai-memory-llm-integration
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. **API Keys**: Obtain your API keys from the LLM provider and store them securely. You may want to use environment variables or a configuration file to manage sensitive information.

2. **Modify the Core Module**: In `src/ai_memory_core.py`, ensure that the integration with the LLM is properly set up. You may need to add methods for sending and receiving messages from the LLM.

## Example Integration

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the AI Memory System with an LLM:

```python
from src.ai_memory_core import PersistentAIMemorySystem

# Initialize the memory system
memory_system = PersistentAIMemorySystem()

# Function to interact with the LLM
def interact_with_llm(prompt):
    # Send the prompt to the LLM and get a response
    response = llm_api.send_prompt(prompt)  # Replace with actual LLM API call
    return response

# Example usage
user_input = "What is the capital of France?"
llm_response = interact_with_llm(user_input)

# Store the conversation in memory
memory_system.store_conversation(content=user_input, role='user')
memory_system.store_conversation(content=llm_response, role='assistant')
```

## Conclusion

Integrating the AI Memory System with LLMs opens up new possibilities for managing and utilizing conversational data. Follow the steps outlined in this guide to set up your integration and start leveraging the power of LLMs in your applications.
