# Integration Guide for Llama AI Memory

## Overview

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to integrate the Persistent AI Memory System with the Llama language model. By following these steps, you will enable the Llama model to access and utilize stored memories effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- The Persistent AI Memory System installed
- The Llama language model installed and configured

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository containing the AI Memory System:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd llama-ai-memory
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Set Up the Memory System**

   Ensure that the AI Memory System is properly configured. You can modify the configuration settings in `src/ai_memory_core.py` as needed.

2. **Integrate with Llama**

   In `src/llama_integration.py`, you will find functions that facilitate communication between the AI Memory System and the Llama model. Make sure to adjust any parameters specific to your Llama setup.

## Code Examples

### Storing Memories

To store a memory in the AI Memory System, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
from src.ai_memory_core import PersistentAIMemorySystem

memory_system = PersistentAIMemorySystem()
memory_id = await memory_system.create_memory(
    content="This is a sample memory for Llama integration.",
    memory_type="integration_example",
    importance_level=5,
    tags=["llama", "integration"]
)
print(f"Memory stored with ID: {memory_id}")
```

### Accessing Memories

To access stored memories from the Llama model, use the following example:

```python
from src.llama_integration import LlamaMemoryAccessor

accessor = LlamaMemoryAccessor()
memories = await accessor.retrieve_memories(query="sample memory")
print("Retrieved Memories:", memories)
```

## Conclusion

By following this integration guide, you should be able to successfully connect the Persistent AI Memory System with the Llama language model. For further assistance, refer to the documentation in the `README.md` file or consult the community forums.
